Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning Experiments

This repository contains my Day 1 reinforcement learning experiments using Tabular Q-Learning on the Taxi-v3 environment, implemented with Gymnasium.
This is the starting point for my broader exploration of Deep RL and Multi-Agent RL (MARL) for my Master’s thesis at Stockholm University (DSV).

Objectives

- Refresh RL fundamentals

- Implement tabular Q-learning

- Train an agent in a simple discrete environment

- Prepare for Deep RL & Multi-Agent RL (MARL)
